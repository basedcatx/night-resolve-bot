Please note that the current branc imp/game would only be changed, once the game has been fully implemented...(implement game)

The game has a very basic setup (for a start)... If the number of townies equals to the number of mafias, the game ends, mafias won.
If the number of mafias zeros then the townies and doctors and the rest won.

With time we would come about with very much more dynamic game themes and settings, as time unveils. For now i just want to get a good and solid version of the game (playable) up and running while the channel grows.
